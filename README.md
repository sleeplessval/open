# open

An opinionated, friendly alternative to `xdg-open` focused on opening files from a
terminal. Easily understandable and configurable with a simple toml file.

Does technically break convention. If you're using the `open` shell builtin, or
otherwise care about compliance, consider installing under a different binary name.
